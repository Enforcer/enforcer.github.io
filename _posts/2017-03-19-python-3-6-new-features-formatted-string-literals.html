<p>On 23. December 2016 new minor version of Python was released - 3.6. It brings few enhancements and syntax features. In my opinion the most notable one is introduction of formatted string literals.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">word = 'world'
print(f'Hello, {word}!')  # prints 'Hello, world</pre>
<p>I always envied Ruby's string interpolation because it is much cleaner and doesn't require programmer to read end of expression just to understand what is substituted where.</p>
<p>String interpolation was always a pain in Python. Not to mention there is more than one way to do it...</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">some_string = "I'm %s" % ('interpolated', )
other_string = "I'm {}".format('interpolated')</pre>
<p>Clear violation of Zen of Python that states:</p>
<blockquote><p>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to violate it even more :evil: we have now third way to do the same thing. Yay!</p>

<p>...but its actually better than previous ones. Syntax of first one is quite concise, but can cause some troubles for python newcomers:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">some_string = "I'm %s" % ('interpolated', )
other_string = "I'm %s" % 'interpolated'  # The same thing! 
another_string = '%s %s' % ("I'm", "interpolated")
yet_another_string = '%s %s' % "I'm", "interpolated"  # Not an option! Raises TypeError</pre>
<p>There is a shortcut that allows to omit giving tuple as argument for string interpolation, but it won't work with more than one argument. Nevertheless - this syntax makes it easy to format arguments just like old good sprintf does.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">'%.2f ' % 5  #  Prints any numeric value as floating point
'%.2f ' % Decimal('5.1254')
'%.2f ' % 5.144</pre>
<p>The same thing can be accomplished using "old-new" .format:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">'{:.2f}'.format(5)
'{:.2f}'.format(Decimal('1.1254'))
'{:.2f}'.format(5.144)</pre>
<p>Way more verbose than previous syntax. Differences between string interpolation are presented on <a href="https://pyformat.info/">pyformat.info</a> - awesome work done by Ulrich Petri and Horst Gutmann.</p>
<p>Getting back to new syntax - it naturally has all features of "old-new" string interpolation with .format function, but removes need to actually call this method.</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">value = Decimal('1.2354')
f'{value:.2f}'
</pre>
<p>This becomes especially helpful when formatting long strings (try to fit in standard PEP8's 80 characters per line without awkward line breaks) or in classes:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Point&lt;{self.x}, {self.y}&gt;'

point = Point(3, 5)
print(point)  # Point&lt;3, 5&gt;</pre>
<p>This was merely a sneak peek of string formatting in Python, but it presented essential aspects of new so-called 'f-strings'.</p>
