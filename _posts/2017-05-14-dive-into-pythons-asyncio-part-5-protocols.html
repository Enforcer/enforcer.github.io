<p>Protocols are asyncio's primitives supplied as convenient base classes to quickly set up clients or servers using TCP/UDP (+ subprocesses). These are especially helpful when we need to implement low level handling of protocol of some sort. I believe they are inspired by <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.internet.protocol.Protocol.html">Twisted's protcols</a>.</p>
<p>Simple example of TCP echo server protocol may be (taken from asyncio docs):</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">import asyncio

class EchoServerClientProtocol(asyncio.Protocol):  # 1
    def connection_made(self, transport):  # 2
        self.transport = transport

    def data_received(self, data):  # 3
        self.transport.write(data)

    def connection_lost(self, exc):  # 4
        print('Connection ended')


loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
coro = loop.create_server(EchoServerClientProtocol, '127.0.0.1', 8888)  # 5
server = loop.run_until_complete(coro)

try:
    loop.run_forever()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass

server.close()
loop.run_until_complete(server.wait_closed())
loop.close()</pre>
<ol>
<li>First thing is to inherit from asyncio-provided base class asyncio.Protocol. It serves for handling TCP and SSL based communication.</li>
<li>Implementing given protocol comes down to writing particular callbacks, starting from <em>connection_made</em> which is invoked everytime we have new connection from the outside.</li>
<li><em>data_received </em>is called when client sends some data to the server</li>
<li>connection_lost is invoked when connection ends either from client side or server.</li>
</ol>
<p>It all seems nice and clean, but where are coroutines? Where is <em>async</em> and <em>await</em>? Well, they are not there. If one needs to introduce them, then they should be decoupled using <em>asyncio.ensure_future</em>:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">class EchoServerClientProtocol(asyncio.Protocol):
    # ...

    def data_received(self, data):
        asyncio.ensure_future(self.some_coro, data)

    async def some_coro(self, data):
        await async_operation
</pre>
