<p>In the world of Python we have quite decent tools for a static code analysis. There are pylint, flake8, pep8 just to name a few. Rules they enforce are based on a solid foundation - <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8 - Style Guide for Python Code</a>. Beside style &amp; convention related issues, tools for SCA can detect errors like using wrong variables, typos etc. This helps a lot and leaves little room for ambiguity when it comes to coding conventions. However, there are situations when no particular convention is enforced by any standard. As a consequence, there are few possible ways of writing something down. Choosing which one is <em>correct</em> is up to the team that owns particular project. Of course from that moment people are responsible for enforcing new law, which of course is error prone.</p>
<h2>Why would anybody write a custom checker?</h2>
<p>I found myself in a similar situation few weeks ago after joining new team. These are team's rules for using import statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obey standard grouping of import statements - first standard library, then 3rd party modules and finally imports from the project</li>
<li>All <em>import</em> statements go before <em>from ... import</em></li>
<li>imports in each group have to be sorted alphabetically</li>
<li>stuff imported inside <em>from ... import</em> has also be sorted</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct example:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">import os
from os import path

from django.conf import settings
from django.db.models import (
    CharField,
    Field,
)

import project.views
from project.models import User

</pre>
<p>Incorrect example:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">from os import path  # this should be after 'import os'
import os

from django.conf import settings
from django.db.models import (
    Field,    # this should be after 'CharField'
    CharField,
)

</pre>
<p>These rules are not something extraordinary, yet it takes some time to get used to them. Even after few months in the project one can make a mistake and misplace imports. I made plenty such errors in the beginning of the work in the project. It must have been irritating for other team members to point out these over and over. So to spare my teammates some nerves and time, I come up with an idea to write a custom checker for pylint.</p>
<p>Pylint is a pluggable piece of software that can be easily extended with such custom rules, yet they have to be programmed. There are two approaches when writing custom checker - treat code as an Abstract Syntax Tree or raw string. For this particular application AST analysis was much more handy, so I went this way.</p>
<h2>What are ASTs, actually?</h2>
<p>Abstract syntax trees are a way of representing code in an easily parsable way. To grasp a general idea, consider following example:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">import astroid


source_code = '''import time

def ten_seconds_ago():
    now = time.time()
    return now - 10
'''

ast = astroid.parse(source_code)
print(ast)
# Module(name='',
#        doc=None,
#        file='&lt;?&gt;',
#        path='&lt;?&gt;',
#        package=False,
#        pure_python=True,
#        future_imports=set(),
#        body=[ &lt;Import l.1 at 0x1049ddf98&gt;,
#          &lt;FunctionDef.ten_seconds_ago l.3 at 0x1049c0048&gt;])
print(ast.body)
# [&lt;Import l.1 at 0x1049ddf98&gt;, &lt;FunctionDef.ten_seconds_ago l.3 at 0x1049c0048&gt;]
print(ast.body[1])
# FunctionDef.ten_seconds_ago(name='ten_seconds_ago',
#                             doc=None,
#                             decorators=None,
#                             args=&lt;Arguments l.3 at 0x1049c00b8&gt;,
#                             returns=None,
#                             body=[ &lt;Assign l.4 at 0x1049bff28&gt;,
#                               &lt;Return l.5 at 0x1049e3320&gt;])</pre>
<p>AST is a structure that contains our code. We see that root element is a <em>Module</em>. In its <em>body</em> it has <em>Import</em> and <em>FunctionDef</em>. If we look further, into <em>FunctionDef</em> element we discover it also has <em>body</em> with <em>Assign</em> and <em>Return</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I use <em>astroid</em> library - it's a boosted variation of standard library's ast module. Pylint uses astroid extensively.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's the basic idea - we get nested structure of objects which represent single statements in our code. Such exemplary piece of code:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">import time

def ten_seconds_ago():
    now = time.time()
    return now - 10</pre>
<p>is turned into this:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-158 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/06/ast.png" alt="" width="481" height="282" /></p>
<p>Of course AST stores additional things such as node position, so it is an exact code representation.</p>
<p>Many pylint's checkers works by visiting nodes in a given AST. One has two callbacks to implement per each node type, <em>visit_&lt;nodename&gt;</em> and <em>leave_&lt;nodename&gt;</em>. First one is invoked when tree traversal reaches particular node and second when we come back as there is no more left to traverse. Depth First Search algorithm is used for traversing the tree. It makes sense, because we are able to gather all statements in a function and inside <em>leave_functiondef </em>do some stuff, like check the number of assignments or something.</p>
<p>Let's start with an implementation of first, simpler rule - all names imported in <em>from .. import</em> should be sorted alphabetically. Prepare example file which violates that rule:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">"""
`getdoc` should land before `getmodule`
"""

from inspect import (
    getmodule,
    getdoc,
)


print(getmodule(getdoc))
print(getdoc(getmodule))
</pre>
<p>Running pylint shows no problems:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true"> ~/P/p/linting&gt; pylint first_rule.py

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 10.00/10 (previous run: 10.00/10, +0.00)
</pre>
<p>First, we need a checker boilerplate code:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">import astroid

from pylint.interfaces import IAstroidChecker
from pylint.checkers import BaseChecker


class AlphabeticallySortedImports(BaseChecker):
    __implements__ = IAstroidChecker

    name = 'alphabetically-sorted-imports-checker'

    UNSORTED_IMPORT_FROM = 'unsorted-import-from'

    DIR_HIGHER = 'higher'
    DIR_LOWER = 'lower'
    # here we define our messages
    msgs = {
        'C5001': ('"%s" in "%s" is in the wrong position. Move it %s.',
                  UNSORTED_IMPORT_FROM,
                  'Refer to project rules on wiki'),
    }
    options = ()

    priority = -1

    def visit_importfrom(self, node):
        pass  # to be implemented

def register(linter):
    """required method to auto register this checker"""
    linter.register_checker(AlphabeticallySortedImports(linter))
</pre>
<p>Actual implementation is pretty easy:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">    def visit_importfrom(self, node):
        # node is an astroid.node_classes.ImportFrom instance
        # it has names property with 2-element tuples that contain
        # object name and it's alias (or None, if not aliased)
        names = [name for name, _alias in node.names]

        # we sort all names to get desired structure
        sorted_names = sorted(names)

        for actual_index, name in enumerate(names):
            correct_index = sorted_names.index(name)

            # if our object is not placed in the same order as in 
            # sorted_names, then we report this fact as a violation
            if correct_index != actual_index:
                direction = self.DIR_LOWER if correct_index &gt; actual_index else self.DIR_HIGHER
                args = name, node.as_string(), direction
                # this function causes pylint to emit warning
                self.add_message(
                    self.UNSORTED_IMPORT_FROM, node=node, args=args
                )</pre>
<p>Now we run pylint with our custom checker and it complains as we expected:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true"> ~/P/p/linting&gt; pylint first_rule.py --load-plugins=alphabetically_sorted_imports
************* Module first_rule
C:  5, 0: "getmodule" in "from inspect import getmodule, getdoc" is in the wrong position. Move it lower. (unsorted-import-from)

<p>Second rule is much more tricky to get it implemented right. By looking into original pylint imports checker module's code I discovered it can be reused, because it already gathers all Import and ImportFrom statements together and can even organize them into groups of entities that come from standard library, 3rd party or are local imports.</p>
<p>First, code that violates this rule:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">"""
`inspect` should land before `from inspect import ...`
`astroid` should be imported before from `pylint.checkers.imports import ImportsChecker`

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No software developer should spent time on manually checking things that SCA should take care of. We have much better things to do. ;) Let me know in the comments if you have ever come across any problem that custom checks of Pylint could solve.</p>
<p>All code presented in this post is GPL-2 licensed (<a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/master/COPYING">just like Pylint</a>), so enjoy. Don't forget to read sources of Pylint - the most fundamental source of information in this blog post.</p>
