<p>Every Django project may encounter a steady increase in a number of migrations over time. One way to lower their quantity is to use <strong>squashing</strong>. Squashing amounts to taking contents of few migrations and connecting them into one. This would reduce their number, but what happens if we squash a bunch of migrations that were already partially applied to one of application's instances?</p>
<p>Let's consider following situation. We have three different migrations in our app:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true "> - 0001_initial
 - 0002_auto_20170531_2038
 - 0003_rental</pre>
<p>We squashed them to one:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">~/squash_versus_cd&gt; ./manage.py squashmigrations core 0001_initial 0003_rental
Will squash the following migrations:
 - 0001_initial
 - 0002_auto_20170531_2038
 - 0003_rental
Do you wish to proceed? [yN] y
Optimizing...
  Optimized from 4 operations to 3 operations.
Created new squashed migration core/migrations/0001_initial_squashed_0003_rental.py</pre>
<p>If we inspect newly created migration's code we discover that django placed a clear sign that our new migration replaces old ones:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">replaces = [
    ('core', '0001_initial'),
    ('core', '0002_auto_20170531_2038'),
    ('core', '0003_rental')
]</pre>
<p>If we ever decided to set up another instance of our application, it django would execute our squashed migration only (<strong>0001_initial_squashed_0003_rental</strong>).</p>
<p>What if we found ourselves in a less pleasant situation, when we have our instance partially migrated? Let's say we have executed migrations 0001 and 0002:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">squash_versus_cd&gt; ./manage.py showmigrations
core
 [X] 0001_initial
 [X] 0002_auto_20170531_2038
 [ ] 0003_rental
</pre>
<p>Unless we deleted original migration files (django won't touch them) we will be able to just run .<strong>/manage.py migrate</strong>. Django will handle this situation.</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">squash_versus_cd&gt; ./manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, core, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying core.0003_rental... OK</pre>
