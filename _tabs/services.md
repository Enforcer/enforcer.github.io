## Mentoring

Set up a [free 20-minutes meeting](https://calendly.com/enforcer/20min) to see how I can help you.

### What is mentoring?

During mentoring sessions, I'll help you solve the challenges that you bring.

Example topics I can help you with:
- Writing leaner code that responds well to requirements changes,
- Improving speed, quality or removing flakiness of your test suite,
- Python tips & tricks,
- Building Python projects with modern tooling,
- Architecture,
- Performance challenges (Python, as well as distributed systems),
- Career planning.

Not seeing your topic on the list or not sure if it's a good one for mentoring sessions? Set up a [free 20-minutes meeting](https://calendly.com/enforcer/20min) or write me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianbuczynski/).

### How does it work?

During the first session we'll frame the problem, draft a plan and agree on what to prepare for the next meeting. The second and following sessions are paid.

It is crucial to bring to the first meeting a challenge you want my help with or some goal you wish to attain. It does not have to be polished, I can help you formulate it, but the more specific, the better.

Mentoring will last as long as you need it. It can be a single session with pair programming or a series of meetings - according to your needs and the plan we draft during the first call.

### How much does it cost?

The price will depend on the number of sessions. Typically, I charge 350 z≈Ç net / 100$ for an hour of mentoring.

Feel free to set up the first [20-minutes long session](https://calendly.com/enforcer/20min) (free of charge) to check how can I help you.
