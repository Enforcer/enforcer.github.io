## Sebastian BuczyÅ„ski

Hi! I'm a dedicated pythoneer with over a decade of commercial experience. 

I train people @ [Bottega IT Minds](https://bottega.com.pl/) and work as a Software Architect @ [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).

I wrote a book called [Implementing the Clean Architecture](https://leanpub.com/implementing-the-clean-architecture) (in Python, of course!).

Check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/Enforcer/) to see other cool things I'm toying with. My newest project is [Python Event Sourcery](https://github.com/Enforcer/python-event-sourcery) - an attempt to provide Pythonistas with a decent event sourcing library.

## Where did collecting breadcrumbs come from?!

Itâ€™s a reference to _I, Robot_ movie. ðŸ˜‰ We need to go deeper, though. If we were to interpret that literally, collecting breadcrumbs in _I, Robot_ stands for Detective Spooner gathering more and more evidence during his investigation. Meanwhile, the character played by Will Smith mentions the phrase several times after noticing it in a fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel.

In the context of this blog, collecting breadcrumbs means an act of learning new things, documented by one post at a time.
